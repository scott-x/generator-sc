# react-generator-sc

## introduction
1. **`react-generator-sc`**: It's a cli for `react`, similar like [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and more like [Angular cli](https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr), since it can not only build project itselft but also build components. So we can call it as `a full-stack cli`.
2. **`templates`**: The templates are base on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), if you hava any good idea about templates, feel free to reach out to me.

## how to use?

### 1. installation
```
npm i react-generator-sc -g

```
### 2. init project
if [yourProjectName] is null, when you run `sc i`, it will create a project called myApp by default.
```
sc i [yourProjectName]
```
## other commands
```
sc g c [yourComponentName]
sc g p [yourPageName]
```
## test
